Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>I'm Drozax. I'm a music producer and web developer. I write electronic music, specifically synthwave. I have been a producer since I was 15 and a musician since I was 10. My mother started me on piano lessons, and I quickly fell in love with it and music. I started experimenting with writing my own songs and published my first one in 2019 using Garageband on my iPad. Not long after, I downloaded the trial version of FL Studios and convinced my parents to buy me the full version. I would intermittently write and publish songs on my YouTube channel and SoundCloud until I started college. After my first semester, I made my own Bandcamp account and started my debut album, which I finished 6 months later on May 27th, 2024, with an EP shortly after.</p>
			<p>I will be using my artist logo as the image in the home page</p>
			<h3>My Gear</h3>
			<p>The software I use to write my music is FL Studios 24 Producers Edition, Arturia V Collection 9, and Serum. The Hardware I use to write my music is a Korg Minilogue XD, a Yamaha ModX 7, an M-Audio Air 192 | 4, and an Epiphone Les Paul II electric guitar.</p>
			<p>I will have a json file that contains the images for the gear I use and will dynamicaly add them to the page along side the information with JS</p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				[Any additional details about home that the wireframe does not make
				clear]
			</p>
			<img src="images/home-wireframe.png" alt="home page wireframe" />

			<h3>My Gear</h3>
			<p>
				[Any additional details about page 2 that the wireframe does not make
				clear]
			</p>
			<img src="images/my-gear-wireframe.png" alt="page 2 wireframe" />
