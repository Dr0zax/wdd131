                American author Orson Scott Card. Set at an unspecified date in
                Earth's future, the novel presents an imperiled humankind after
                two conflicts with an insectoid alien species they dub "the
                buggers".

                For centuries, mystical creatures of all description were
                gathered to a hidden refuge called Fablehaven to prevent their
                extinction. The sanctuary is one of the last strongholds of true
                magic. Enchanting? Absolutely. Exciting? You bet. Safe? Well,
                actually, quite the opposite . . . Kendra and her brother, Seth,
                have no idea their grandfather is the current caretaker of
                Fablehaven. Inside the gated woods, ancient laws keep order
                among greedy trolls, mischievous satyrs, plotting witches,
                spiteful imps, and jealous fairies. However, when the rules get
                broken, powerful forces of evil are unleashed, forcing Kendra
                and Seth to face the greatest challenge of their lives, to save
                their family, Fablehaven, and perhaps even the world.
